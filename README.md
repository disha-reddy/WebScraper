# WebScraper
Background
Web crawling is integral to how the internet functions. For example, Google search would not work if not for the hundreds of billions of page crawls that Google has executed and indexed. Web crawling is a useful way to gather publicly available information on the internet.

Task

• Create a rerunnable application that can crawl a configurable list of URLs
• Start with these 4 URLs: 

• https://www.spigot.com/ 

• https://readscripture.net/

• https://earlychirp.com/

• https://living.guide/fashion/3-chic-cocktail-dresses-for-any-occasion/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=Facebook_Mobile_Feed&utm_campaign=23850811306770197&utm_content=fb-23851005666410197&search_term=big%20tall%20apparel

• List all images from each URL in a CSV format with sizing information if available.

1. Somehow differentiate which images are ads in your output
2. Save the images in a local zip folder

The libraries imoprted are BeautifulSoup, lxml, requests, ImageFile, urllib, urllib.request, csv, os, shutil. 

All of the above mentioned libraries have to be installed in your respective system prior to the compilation of the code.
